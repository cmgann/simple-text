    <h3>Data Field:</h3>
    <p>
        Type your data in the Data field for the text that you would like to manipulate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: <br>
        John,Doe <br>
        Jane,Doe
    </p>
    <p>
        Be sure to verify that your Separators are accurate. For this we will use: <br>
        Column Separator = , <br>
        Row Separator = /n
    </p>
    <p>
        ** Hint, the /n means that it is for the next line, we will go over this more below
        in the Separator Help section. **
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Pattern Field:</h3>
    <p>
        Type your pattern for which you would like to the "$" to tag where you would
        like to insert the text from your Data Field.
    </p>
    <p>
    Example: <br>
    First Name: $0 <br>
    Last Name: $1 <br>
    </p>
    <p>This will have the Result: <br>
        First Name: John <br>
        Last Name: Doe <br> <br>
        First Name: Jane <br>
        Last Name: Doe
    </p>
    <p>
        *** Important, the first tag will start with $0 the next tag would be $1 and so on. ***
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Separator Help:</h3>
    Some Separators will need to start with a '\' some examples below: <br>
    \n = New Line <br>
    \t = Tab <br>
    \| = | (Pipe)

    <p>
        Most normal characters will not require '\'.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>You can save your pattern for future use!</h3>
    <p>
        If you have a pattern added in that you would like to save for your common tasks,
        then click on the Menu button to the right of the dropdown and click "save". 
    </p>
    <p>
        Then later on when you visit you can select it from the drop down menu and it will
        automaticly populate your pattern for you.
